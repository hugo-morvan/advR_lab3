Repository for Lab 3 in Advanced R programming 732A94.
Author : Hugo Morvan, Simge Cinar

This package contains two functions which are Euclidean and Dijkstra Algorithm. Euclidean algorithm takes two numeric scalars as input and finds the largest number that divides both of them without remainder. Dijkstra algorithm takes a graph and initial node as input and  finds the shortest path from initial node to the other nodes in the graph.

PS: This repository is the second version for this project due to too many issues on the first one. It was created using the colelctive from the first version by one person but does not reflect the total contribution of the group members.
